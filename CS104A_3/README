Overview
Augment your string table and scanner by adding an oc parser to the project. The
output of this project will be an abstract syntax tree written to the file program.ast,
in addition to the files generated from the previous two projects. All specifications
from the first two projects apply, and in addition, the -y flag must turn on yydebug.


SYNOPSIS
oc [-ly] [-@ flag ...] [-D string] program.oc
The main function will open a pipe to the C preprocessor as before, but will never
call yylex(). Instead it makes a single call to yyparse(), which will call yylex() as
needed. When yyparse() returns, the main function will call a function to dump the
AST. The function yyparse() calls yyerror() to print an error message whenever it
detects a syntax error and has to recover. The -y flag must turn on the yydebug
switch. Generate a file called program.ast based on the input file name, and also
generate all files specified in earlier projects.
